= Third-party services =

This plugin connects to third-party services to display observation and map data.

* iNaturalist API and observation media: The plugin sends the configured source values, such as project slug, project ID, place ID, user ID/login, page number, per-page count, and selected taxon filter, to the iNaturalist API. It uses these requests to retrieve observations, source statistics, project data, place data, place boundary geometry, and observation photo URLs. Front-end pages may load observation images from the image URLs returned by iNaturalist, including iNaturalist/Open Data storage URLs. No WordPress user account data is intentionally sent by the plugin. iNaturalist API documentation: https://api.inaturalist.org/v1/docs/ Terms: https://www.inaturalist.org/terms Privacy policy: https://www.inaturalist.org/privacy
* Esri ArcGIS World Topographic Map tiles: The map view loads terrain/topographic map tiles from Esri ArcGIS. Browser requests to Esri include normal web request data such as IP address and user agent.

= Bundled third-party libraries =

This plugin bundles Leaflet 1.9.4 for the interactive map. Leaflet is licensed under the BSD 2-Clause License. The license is included at assets/vendor/leaflet/LICENSE. Leaflet project: https://leafletjs.com/

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory, or install it through the WordPress Plugins screen.
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins screen in WordPress.
3. Go to Settings > iNaturalist Observations to configure default source settings.
4. Add the iNaturalist Observations block or iNaturalist Observations Map block to a page.

The plugin creates draft starter iNaturalist Observations and Map of Observations pages on activation if those pages do not already exist. Review and publish those pages when ready.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin require an iNaturalist API key? =

No. It uses public iNaturalist API endpoints.

= Does this plugin store observation data permanently? =

The plugin caches API responses in WordPress transients to reduce page-load time and API pressure. The cache can be cleared from the plugin settings page.

= Can I use a shortcode instead of blocks? =

Yes. Use [ucnature_inat_observations] for the grid view or [ucnature_inat_observations_map] for the map view.
